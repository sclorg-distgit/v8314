The Software collection %{scl_name} is only ment to provide functionality for 
other software collections such as nodejs or mongodb.

Package %{scl_name} provides V8 JavaScript engine delivered as a Software
Collection. For more information about Software Collections,
see the scl(1) man page. By installing the %{scl_name} collection,
you will get the minimum working set of packages to have a working
V8 JavaScript engine.

Usage: scl enable %{scl} 'd8'

Software Collections allow you to build and execute applications
which are not located in the filesystem root hierarchy,
but are stored in an alternative location, which is %{_scl_root}
in case of the %{scl_name} collection.

V8 is Google's open source JavaScript engine. V8 is written in C++ and is used
in Google Chrome, the open source browser from Google. V8 implements ECMAScript
as specified in ECMA-262, 3rd edition.

When you want to work with the %{scl_name} collection, use the scl
utility (see the scl(1) man page for usage) to enable the scl
environment.

Configuration for the %{scl_name} software collection is located
under %{_sysconfdir}.

Examples:
scl enable %{scl_name} 'command --arg'
  Run a specific command with the argument --arg within the %{scl_name}
  software collections environment.

scl enable %{scl_name} 'd8'
  Run d8 from the %{scl_name} software collection.

scl enable %{scl_name} bash
  Run an interactive shell with the %{scl_name} software collection enabled.
